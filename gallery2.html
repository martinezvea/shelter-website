		<div class="dog1">I adopted Teddy a few weeks ago, and she now goes by Rooney! This little girl is the sweetest, spunkiest pup. We have taken her to the Potomac river where she dove right in and had a blast running around Zach’s family’s giant yard in VA. Now back in the city, she goes to the dog park every day and makes friends with any dog that comes her way. Just wanted to share with you this update and let you at animal haven know how thankful we are that you let her be part of our family.</div>
